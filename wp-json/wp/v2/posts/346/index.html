Start by creating a new board or selecting a template that fits your needs. Once your board is set, organize the elements within it using frames, sticky notes, and connectors. A well-organized board will make it easier to understand the content when printed as a PDF.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">Review Board Settings and Permissions<\/h3>\n<p>Since you&#8217;re going to export your Miro board, it&#8217;s essential to review the board settings and adjust permissions accordingly. Depending on your preference, you can choose to keep the board private or share it with specific collaborators. If you want to share the board with a broader audience, you can enable public access.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Check Board Size and Resolution<\/h3>\n<p>The size of your Miro board directly affects the resolution of the PDF output. Ensure that the board size is suitable for printing to achieve the desired print quality.

You can choose the page range, adjust the image quality, and even include or exclude backgrounds from the export. Based on your intended use, select the appropriate settings to optimize the PDF output.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_6\">Export and Download the PDF<\/h3>\n<p>With your settings in place, hit the export button, and Miro will start generating the PDF file. Once the export is complete, download the PDF to your computer.
