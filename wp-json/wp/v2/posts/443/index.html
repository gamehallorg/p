Current reservation allows you to book tickets at the last moment, even a few hours before the train departure, subject to availability.<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Subheading: When to Opt for Current Reservation?<\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Current reservation is ideal for situations when your travel plans are sudden and you couldn&#8217;t secure a confirmed ticket in advance. It is also useful if you miss your train or need to change your travel date at the last minute.<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Subheading: Advantages and Limitations of Current Reservation<\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Current reservation offers the convenience of booking tickets at the last moment, but it is subject to availability and does not guarantee a confirmed seat. It is more suitable for short-distance travel, and the fare can be higher compared to regular bookings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_5\">Heading: Using the IRCTC App for Current Reservation<\/h3>\n<p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_6\">Subheading: Downloading and Installing the IRCTC App<\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>The first step to booking a current reservation ticket is to download and install the official IRCTC app on your smartphone. The app is available for both Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the respective app stores.<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_7\">Subheading: Creating or Logging into Your IRCTC Account<\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you already have an IRCTC account, simply log in using your credentials.
