Video games provide a sense of accomplishment, competition, and a virtual world where they can escape reality. Violent games might offer an adrenaline rush and a feeling of power, which can be particularly enticing.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">Open Communication and Active Listening<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-sophie-sitting-on-wallace-7199675' alt=\"My 12-year-old son continues to play violent video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account.

Instead of approaching the conversation with frustration, express your concerns and curiosity. Ask your child about the games they enjoy playing and why they find them engaging. Listening to their perspective can help you gain insight into their motivations and feelings.<\/p>\n<h4>Key points:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a calm and non-confrontational environment for the conversation.<\/li>\n<li>Show genuine interest in their gaming experiences.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid judgment and criticism during the discussion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Set Clear Boundaries and Limits<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-covid-restaurant-opening-vanderbilt-brooklyn-8917780' alt=\"My 12-year-old son continues to play violent video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account.

Work together with your child to define reasonable time limits for gaming sessions. Be transparent about the consequences if these limits are exceeded. Encourage your child to take breaks, engage in other activities, and maintain a healthy balance between screen time and other interests.<\/p>\n<h4>Key points:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Involve your child in the process of setting boundaries.<\/li>\n<li>Use a timer or alarms to signal the end of gaming sessions.<\/li>\n<li>Discuss and agree on consequences for violating the established limits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Explore Alternative Activities<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-inviskid1-e-scaled-2371416' alt=\"My 12-year-old son continues to play violent video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account.

Encourage them to pursue hobbies, sports, arts and crafts, reading, or spending time with friends. Highlight the benefits of engaging in real-world activities, such as social interaction, skill development, and personal growth.<\/p>\n<h4>Key points:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Research activities that align with your child&#8217;s interests.<\/li>\n<li>Participate in activities together to strengthen your bond.<\/li>\n<li>Provide positive reinforcement when your child engages in alternative activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_5\">Seek Professional Guidance<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-xukki1pa6hr71-2416887' alt=\"My 12-year-old son continues to play violent video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account.
