From conquering bosses to discovering hidden secrets, the game saves your achievements in the background, ensuring that your efforts are not lost in the face of peril.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">Manual Saving Options<\/h3>\n<p>As players delve deeper into the unpredictable world of Dead Cells, the option to manually save progress becomes increasingly important.

Dead Cells masterfully balances permadeath with a unique progression system that allows you to retain certain benefits and unlockables across subsequent playthroughs.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Keeping Progress Between Runs<\/h3>\n<p>Central to this ingenious balance is the concept of &#8220;cells.&#8221; These valuable resources serve as currency for unlocking permanent upgrades, blueprints for new weapons and abilities, and other useful items that persist between runs. Your strategic choices in each run directly impact your progression in future attempts, providing a sense of continuity amidst the seemingly endless cycle of life and death.<\/p>\n<h2>Save Management and Troubleshooting<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_5\">Backing Up Save Files<\/h3>\n<p>With countless hours poured into mastering Dead Cells, it becomes crucial to safeguard your progress.
