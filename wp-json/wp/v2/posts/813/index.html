What should I do\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-laptop-1842297-1920-9909114.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s natural for children to feel frustrated and upset when their access to something they enjoy is limited, especially in the case of video games. The first step towards resolving the conflict is to open up lines of communication. Sit down with your son and have an open and honest conversation. Express your concerns about the content of the games and your desire to ensure his overall well-being. Encourage him to share his thoughts and feelings, and actively listen to what he has to say. This will help both of you understand each other&#8217;s perspectives better.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">Empathy and Validation<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-220411-r40205-3130834' alt=\"I broke my 12-year-old sons laptop screen because he was playing violent video games.

What should I do\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-220411-r40205-3130834.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>Empathy is a powerful tool in resolving conflicts. While explaining your reasons for restricting his access to violent video games, acknowledge his feelings. Let him know that you understand how much he enjoys playing the games and that his frustration and anger are valid. This validation can go a long way in defusing his emotional response and creating a space for constructive dialogue.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Exploring Alternative Activities<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-00nyvirus-parents1-superjumbo-6736170' alt=\"I broke my 12-year-old sons laptop screen because he was playing violent video games.

What should I do\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-00nyvirus-parents1-superjumbo-6736170.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>After addressing his feelings and concerns, work together to explore alternative activities that he might enjoy. This could be a great opportunity to introduce him to new hobbies, sports, or interests that align with your values and provide a healthier outlet for his energy and creativity. Finding an activity he&#8217;s passionate about can help shift his focus away from video games and contribute to his personal growth and development.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Setting Boundaries and Expectations<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-00nyvirus-parents1-mediumsquareat3x-2102273' alt=\"I broke my 12-year-old sons laptop screen because he was playing violent video games.

Discuss these boundaries with your son and involve him in the process. By involving him in the decision-making, he&#8217;ll feel a sense of ownership and responsibility. Create a schedule that balances screen time with other activities, schoolwork, and family time. Be consistent in enforcing these boundaries to establish a routine that benefits his overall well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, parenting is a journey filled with ups and downs, and conflicts are a natural part of the process. By approaching the situation with empathy, communication, and a focus on finding common ground, you can work towards resolving the tension and fostering a stronger parent-child relationship. Through open dialogue, validation of feelings, exploring alternatives, and setting clear boundaries, you can guide your 12-year-old son towards a healthier relationship with video games and a more balanced life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Parenting in the digital age comes with its fair share of challenges, and one of the most common struggles is managing a child&#8217;s interaction with&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":191,"featured_media":502,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[8],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.7 -
