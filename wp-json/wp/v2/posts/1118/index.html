A standard football game consists of four quarters, each lasting 15 minutes. If the scores of both teams are tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game enters into overtime. But what exactly happens during this additional period?<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">The Coin Toss and Possession<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-1439659617-8470912' alt=\"When does a football game enter into overtime\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-1439659617-8470912.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>As the game enters overtime, a coin toss takes place to determine which team will have the first possession. The winner of the coin toss can choose to receive the ball or kick it to the opposing team. Possession is crucial in overtime, as the team with the ball has the opportunity to score and potentially win the game with a touchdown or field goal.<\/p>\n<h4>The Possession Rules<\/h4>\n<p>In the NFL, both teams typically have a fair chance to possess the ball in overtime. If the team with the first possession scores a touchdown on their opening drive, they win the game. However, if they score a field goal, the opposing team gets a chance to possess the ball and attempt to match or exceed their score.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the first possession results in no score (for example, a punt, turnover, or missed field goal), the opposing team has the opportunity to secure victory by scoring a touchdown. If they score a field goal, the game continues, and the next scorewhether a field goal or a touchdowndetermines the winner.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Overtime Duration<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-texas-am-ot-win-090321-getty-ftr-1a0wn5s3nr6mu11bpu3aw3hz8d-7663285' alt=\"When does a football game enter into overtime\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-texas-am-ot-win-090321-getty-ftr-1a0wn5s3nr6mu11bpu3aw3hz8d-7663285.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>The duration of overtime varies between different football leagues. In the NFL, for instance, the first team to score wins the game, and the maximum duration of overtime is one 10-minute period. However, if the team with the first possession scores a touchdown on their opening drive, the game ends immediately. If they score a field goal, the opposing team gets a chance to possess the ball. If neither team scores in the 10-minute period, the game ends in a tie.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Playoff Overtime Rules<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-27osu-mich-web3-superjumbo-1116920' alt=\"When does a football game enter into overtime\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-27osu-mich-web3-superjumbo-1116920.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>Playoff games have a slightly different overtime format to ensure a clear winner. In the NFL playoffs, for instance, both teams are guaranteed a possession unless the first possession results in a touchdown. If the team with the first possession scores a field goal, the opposing team gets a chance to possess the ball. If they also score a field goal, the game continues. If one team scores a touchdown, they win the game.<\/p>\n<p>If the game is still tied after both teams have had a possession, the rules follow a sudden death format. The next scorewhether a field goal or a touchdowndetermines the winner.<\/p>\n<p>Football games entering overtime provide an exhilarating experience for players and fans alike. The anticipation of sudden death scenarios, the strategic decisions made during the coin toss, and the high-stakes moments on the field make overtime periods some of the most memorable in the world of sports.<\/p>\n<p>So, the next time you&#8217;re watching a football game and it&#8217;s headed into overtime, you&#8217;ll know exactly what&#8217;s at stake and how the rules work to determine the final outcome.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Football is a sport that captures the hearts of fans around the world.
