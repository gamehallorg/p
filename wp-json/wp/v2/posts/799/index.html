You might be wondering why you can&#8217;t reinstall the game you bought when it&#8217;s included in GamePass. Let&#8217;s delve into this puzzling scenario and shed light on why this happens.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"bf_toc_container\">\n<div class=\"bf_toc_title\">Table Of Contents<\/div>\n<nav>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#bf_toc_1\" title=\"Game Purchase vs. GamePass Subscription\">Game Purchase vs. GamePass Subscription<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#bf_toc_2\" title=\"Ownership and License\">Ownership and License<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#bf_toc_3\" title=\"Reinstallation Limitations\">Reinstallation Limitations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#bf_toc_4\" title=\"Understanding Digital Rights Management (DRM)\">Understanding Digital Rights Management (DRM)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/nav>\n<\/div>\n<h3 id=\"bf_toc_1\">Game Purchase vs. GamePass Subscription<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-8p6xiak0jfr41-9624011' alt=\"If I bought a game on the Xbox store and the same game that I bought appears in GamePass and I dont have a GamePass subscription anymore, why doesnt it let me reinstall the game I bought\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-8p6xiak0jfr41-9624011.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>When you buy a game from the Xbox Store, you acquire a license to play that specific game. This license is tied to your Xbox account and allows you to access and play the game whenever you want, even if it gets removed from the Xbox Store at a later time. On the other hand, Xbox GamePass is a subscription service that grants you access to a curated collection of games for as long as your subscription is active.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_2\">Ownership and License<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-comingsoon-6t-coming-soon-7ff954e7ec5667efbba1-3037958' alt=\"If I bought a game on the Xbox store and the same game that I bought appears in GamePass and I dont have a GamePass subscription anymore, why doesnt it let me reinstall the game I bought\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-comingsoon-6t-coming-soon-7ff954e7ec5667efbba1-3037958.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>The key distinction lies in ownership versus licensing. When you purchase a game, you own a license for that game. It&#8217;s like buying a DVD of a movie  you can watch it whenever you want, regardless of whether it&#8217;s available on a streaming platform. When a game is available on GamePass, it means that you have access to it as long as you&#8217;re subscribed to GamePass, but you don&#8217;t own a license to the game.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_3\">Reinstallation Limitations<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-dfo3blkb7ou51-1939079' alt=\"If I bought a game on the Xbox store and the same game that I bought appears in GamePass and I dont have a GamePass subscription anymore, why doesnt it let me reinstall the game I bought\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-dfo3blkb7ou51-1939079.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s address the main question: why can&#8217;t you reinstall the game you purchased if it&#8217;s available on GamePass?<\/p>\n<p>This happens because when you buy a game, your access to it is based on ownership of the license. However, when a game is part of GamePass, your access is tied to your subscription. If you previously bought the game and later canceled your GamePass subscription, you no longer have access to the GamePass version of the game. But since you own the license for the game you purchased, you can still install and play that version.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><h3 id=\"bf_toc_4\">Understanding Digital Rights Management (DRM)<\/h3>\n<p><img alt='gamehall-org-tw-coming-soon-5-30-2023-2ae30a0deddac1023c8c-2262943' alt=\"If I bought a game on the Xbox store and the same game that I bought appears in GamePass and I dont have a GamePass subscription anymore, why doesnt it let me reinstall the game I bought\" src='https:\/\/gamehall.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/gamehall.org-tw-coming-soon-5.30.2023-2ae30a0deddac1023c8c-2262943.jpg'\/><\/p>\n<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) plays a role in this scenario. Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox platform utilizes DRM to manage the distribution and usage of digital content. When you purchase a game, the DRM system grants you a license to play it. GamePass games are also governed by DRM, but the access is linked to your subscription status.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><p>So, while it might seem confusing that you can&#8217;t reinstall the GamePass version of a game you bought, it&#8217;s important to remember that ownership and subscription-based access are distinct concepts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><p>Next time you encounter this situation, you can confidently explain why you can still enjoy the game you purchased, even if it&#8217;s available on Xbox GamePass!<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you&#8217;ve purchased a game from the Xbox Store, only to discover that the same game is&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":198,"featured_media":795,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.7 -
